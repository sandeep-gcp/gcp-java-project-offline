Description
Google Cloud App Engine provides a solid, easy-to-access platform for a wide range of web apps. Its interoperability with other Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Datastore, enhances its effectiveness. In this hands-on lab, weâ€™ll deploy an app to App Engine that allows users to enter details into a NoSQL database, Cloud Datastore, and displays the proper HTML template and CSS. The process requires that we customize the config.py file before deploying the app.

Objectives
Successfully complete this lab by achieving the following learning objectives:

Enable APIs and clone GitHub repository.

From the main navigation, visit the APIs & Services > Libraries page, and search for "Datastore".
Select the Cloud Datastore API.
If the API is not available, click Enable.
Repeat the process to enable the Cloud Build API and Container Registry API
Activate the Cloud Shell.
When it spins up, create the necessary bucket (bucket name must be unique): gsutil mb -c regional -l us-east1 gs://[BUCKET_NAME] gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
Clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-gc-essentials
Change directory to the content-gc-essentials/app-engine-lab folder.
Configure `config.py` file.

From the Cloud Shell Editor, open config.py in the app-engine-lab folder.
Change PROJECT_ID to the current project, as shown in the Cloud Shell.
Change the "CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET" variable value to your unique bucket name.
Save the file.
Deploy the app.

In the Cloud Shell, enter the following code:
gcloud config set app/cloud_build_timeout 6000s
gcloud app deploy
When prompted, choose the us-east1 region.
Test the app.

In the Cloud Shell, enter the following code:
gcloud app browse
